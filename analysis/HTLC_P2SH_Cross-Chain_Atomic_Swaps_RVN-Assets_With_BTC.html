            <br>
            The Proof-of-Concept (POC) shown here is an atomic swap in
            which tokens are purchased on the Ravencoin block chain in
            exchange for bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain. Since this
            capability is not yet live on Ravencoin mainnet, this POC
            exchange is between Ravencoin testnet-7 and Bitcoin
            testnet-3.<br>
            <br>
            <font size="+3"><b>How is this possible?:</b></font><br>
            <br>
            This functionality is enabled by the new P2SH code currently
            running on testnet which is planned for mainnet release.
            This same code will also make it possible to lock assets
            into Multi-signature contracts.<br>

            <u>For this POC, the following addresses were used and were

            <u><b>The cross-chain atomic swap takes place in the
                following steps:</b></u><br>
            <br>
            <b>1) Alice starts the process by:</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Selecting a random 32-byte secret.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Using bitcoin script to write an HTLC
            contract which will lock up her BTC payment for the tokens
            she wants to buy.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) She then calculates and sends the
            INITIATE transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alice's transaction uses P2SH to lock her
            BTC payment into an HTLC contract. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HTLC scriptPubKey is written in such
            a way that it can be spent by a signature from Bob's BTC
            address key (if Bob completes the swap), or by Alice's BTC
            address key (if the swap is cancelled and Alice takes her
            refund). Spending to Bob is locked by Hash(secret), the hash
            of the secret Alice chose. Spending to herself is locked 48
            hours into the future.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <b>2) Alice then communicates with Bob by Direct-Messaging
              to send him:</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The transaction number of her INITIATE
            transaction, and<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) The full code of her&nbsp; HTLC

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob can calculate that the Hash160 of

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob was also able to see Hash(secret)
            which is locking up the BTC payment he wants to receive.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Alice held up her end of the
            bargain, it is Bob's turn to proceed.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <b>3) Bob then proceeds by:</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Using ravencoin script to write an

            he wants to sell <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) He then calculates and sends the

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (See the next step for the details about
            the PARTICIPATE transaction.)<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob's transaction uses P2SH to lock his
            TEST_TOKEN assets into an HTLC contract. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HTLC scriptPubKey is written in such
            a way that it can be spent by a signature from Alice's RVN
            address key (if Alice completes the swap), or by Bob's RVN
            address key (if the swap is cancelled and Bob takes back his
            token refund). <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spending to Alice is
            locked by the same Hash(secret) which Alice used. Bob
            doesn't know "secret", but he saw Hash(secret) in the
            contract. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spending to himself is
            locked 24 hours into the future.<br>
            <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you carefully study this REDEEM
            transaction, you should focus on the scriptSig of input
            Vin[1] which is used to unlock Bob's P2SH contract.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>That scriptSig which Alice calculated
              has the following form:</u><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signature using the
            key for Alice's RVN address<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIGHASH_ALL<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PubKey of Alice's
            RVN address<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The full 32-byte
            secret which Alice chose at the beginning<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OP_1 (a "True" which
            indicates that the first clause in the contract is being
            chosen)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The full 81-byte
            contract which Bob provided<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that in order to take possession of
            the TEST_TOKEN asset which she purchase, Alice had to reveal
            the "secret" to the world by including it in plain text in
            this transaction.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <b>6) Bob can now calculate and send his PARTICIPATOR_REDEEM
              transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, in which he take
              possession of 0.01 Bitcoin which Alice paid </b><b>for
              his TEST_TOKEN assets.</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this POC, Bob's PARTICIPATOR_REDEEM
            transaction on the BTC blockchain is:<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to see that the 0.01 BTC payment from
            Alice (minus a BTC transaction fee) has been transferred
            into his BTC address<br>
            <br>
            <u><b>THAT'S IT !!!&nbsp; EASY-PEASY (well... sort of)

            Note that if either Bob or Alice, or both, had become
            uncooperative or unavailable at any time during the swap,
            the activity could have been unwound using an
            INITIATOR_REFUND transaction (after 48 hours) and/or a
            PARTICIPATOR_REFUND transaction (after 24 hours).<br>
            <br>
            The format of REFUND transactions are similar to the REDEEM
            transactions, except that the scriptSigs use OP_0 opcode (to
            select the 2nd clause in the contract), and don't need to
            include the "secret"<br>
