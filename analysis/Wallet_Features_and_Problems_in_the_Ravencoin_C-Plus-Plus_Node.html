            <br>
            <b>Background:</b><br>
            <br>
            Last month I committed to spending some of my free time on
            improving the quality and functionality of the Ravencoin C++
            node software. I have started documenting my code changes at
            <a href="https://github.com/hans-schmidt/raventoo-qt">https://github.com/hans-schmidt/raventoo-qt</a>
            and I intend to post an assortment of code improvements over
            the coming weeks. Obviously one of the most important
            functions of that software is to serve as your keychain and
            transaction utility for the RVN coins and assets which you
            own. In order to reduce confusion, I redesigned the wallet
            creation GUI as documented <a
              href="../raventoo-qt/Improving_the_raven-qt_Mnemonic_Dialog.html">HERE</a>.
            But I have also observed a number of functional problems
            with the wallet. The Discord forum also records quite a few
            problems and misunderstandings in this area. Hopefully, this
            document can provide some help in understanding and using
            the wallet. <br>
            <br>
            The Ravencoin C++ node software stores your wallet
            information in a file called "wallet.dat". That file
            contains primarily three types of information:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Your keys (and associated addresses) - if you lose
                these then you lose access to your RVN coins and assets.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Your metadata (such as optional names you created for
                certain addresses or transactions) - these are useful
                but not needed for ownership.</li>
              <li>The transaction details for all transactions which
                involve your addresses - this information can always be
                re-fetched from the blockchain, but the wallet needs it
                in order to properly calculate and show your RVN coin
                and asset balances.<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <b>Wallet Types:<br>
              <br>
            </b>Historically in crypto-currencies there are basically
            four major types of wallets:<br>
            <br>
            1) Wallets which generate new keys randomly and you need to
            make a copy of your wallet every time a new key pair is
            generated. Thankfully, those are no longer used (at least
            not by us)<br>
            <br>
            2) HD (Hierarchical Deterministic- called BIP-32) wallets
            which generate all their keys from an initial seed. The
            Ravencoin ravend/raven-qt C++ node software prior to
            V4.0.0.0 used this type of wallet. Since all keys are
            derived from the initial seed, you only need to make a
            backup one time, and all future generated keys can be
            regenerated from the backup. That seed is randomly generated
            at wallet initialization. Many of these wallets support
            being encrypted using an encryption passphrase- a feature
            which you should use for improved security. But you need
            BOTH the "wallet.dat" file AND the encryption passphrase to
            recover your keys. It is also worth knowing that when you
            encrypt an existing wallet, the random initial seed is
            replaced with a new one, so you need to make a new backup of
            your "wallet.dat" file. <br>
            <br>
            3) BIP-44 HD wallets- BIP-44 is a specific implementation of
            BIP-32 that defines the coin type and support for multiple
            accounts on top of having receiving addresses and change
            addresses in their own tree. BIP-44 primarily just provides
            better compatibility between different wallets and key
            generation utilities, which could prove particularly
            important if a wallet software which you used becomes
            obsoleted and unavailable. Ravencoin BIP-44 compliance was
            added to the C++ wallet starting with release V4.0.0.0.<br>
            <br>
            4) BIP-39 (Mnemonic code deterministic) wallets- these are
            HD wallets which generate their initial seed from a set of
            12 to 24 mnemonic code words, and an optional mnemonic
            passphrase. With this type of wallet, the mnemonic code
            words (and required mnemonic passphrase if you used one) is
            all you need to recover your coins and assets. The ravencoin
            Android wallet works this way. Ravencoin BIP-39 compliance
            was also added to the C++ wallet using 12 mnemonic code
            words and an optional mnemonic passphrase starting with
            release V4.0.0.0. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An optional encryption passphrase in also
            supported to encrypt your on-disk "wallet.dat" file for
            improved security, but the encryption passphrase is not
            needed to re-create your keys. Note, however, that if you
            lose your "wallet.dat" file and re-create your keys using
            your mnemonic words and mnemonic passphrase, you will lose
            your helpful metadata. For that reason, it is still best
            practice to keep backups of your "wallet.dat" file. You
            should record your mnemonic code words and mnemonic
            passphrase as Plan-B. But you don't need to know or enter
            the mnemonic passphrase or the 12 seed words if you have
            your valid "wallet.dat" file and encryption passphrase, and
            in fact you can do a "dumpwallet" RPC call or GUI Debug
            Console command to see them.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also worth mentioning that if you
            use any of the available methods to import keys into your
            BIP-39 wallet, then those keys will be lost and cannot be
            mnemonically re-created if you lose your "wallet.dat" file.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more time to guarantee clarity: There
            are two possible types of wallet "passphrase". <br>
            <blockquote>
              <ul>
                <li>The "mnemonic passphrase" is an optional item which
                  is used to encrypt the 12 seed words used by BIP-39.
                  It is entered into the wallet creation mnemonic dialog
                  GUI together with the 12 mnemonic words. If you choose
                  to use a "mnemonic passphrase" when you create a
                  wallet, then you will need to know that passphrase in
                  addition to the 12 seed words in order to re-create
                  the wallet in the future if your "wallet.dat" file is
                  corrupted or lost. You don't need to know or enter the
                  mnemonic passphrase or the 12 seed words if you have
                  your valid "wallet.dat" file, and in fact you can do a
                  "dumpwallet" RPC call or GUI Debug Console command to
                  see them.</li>
                <li>The "wallet encrypt passphrase" is an optional
                  passphrase used to encrypt your "wallet.dat" file. It
                  is entered from the GUI main menu --&gt; "Wallet"
                  --&gt; "Encrypt Wallet". If you choose to encrypt your
                  "wallet.dat" file using this passphrase, then you will
                  need to know and enter this passphrase in order to
                  access your coins even if you have your valid
                  "wallet.dat" file. This type of passphrase can be used
                  with legacy pre-BIP-39 Ravencoin wallets or with newer
                  version BIP-39 compliant Ravencoin wallets.</li>

            <b><br>
              Problems with wallet balances, especially when re-creating
              a wallet</b><br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you re-create your "wallet.dat" file
            using the 12 BIP-39 mnemonic seed words (and optional
            mnemonic passphrase), you will probably find that your
            wallet does not show your correct RVN balance or the assets
            which you own. The intended method of solving that problem
            (contrary to the button labelling) is to use the "Rescan
            blockchain files" button of the "Wallet Repair" tab of the
            GUI "Debug Window" or to restart the node software with the
            "-rescan" command line option. Unfortunately, bugs in
            raven-qt (as of v4.3.2.1) have always prevented 2 of the 3
            buttons on the "Wallet Repair" tab from functioning properly
            most of the time because they cause a software restart and
            depend on the same function as the "-rescan" CLI option,
            which is also broken. For that reason, the common advice on
            the helpdesk forums is to use the "Rebuild index" button on
            the "Wallet Repair" tab or to restart raven-qt with the
            -reindex option. Although that works, it is a VERY slow
            operation which can take many hours or even days, and which
            is totally unnecessary. Note that if you have bitcoin and
            use the bitcoin-qt node software, a reindex is not necessary
            when replacing a "wallet.dat" file (only a rescan is needed
            - see technical explanation below).<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some users have reported that this
            problem does not happen if they have "txindex=1" and
            "assetindex=1" in their "raven.conf" file, or if their
            wallet is used for only certain types of transactions- I am
            unable to confirm that behavior. In any case, those indices
            also take a long time to build and are totally unnecessary
            for successful wallet re-creation.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correcting the "rescan bug" in raven-qt
            is non-trivial because it is caused by a race condition
            which causes the rescan to most often take place before all
            the necessary information is available in memory. The
            solution therefore requires a rescan scheduling function to
            schedule the rescan to take place when all the needed
            resources become available. Note that due to this problem,
            the following RPC commands which depend on rescan
            functionality are also negatively affected and are likely to
            cause your wallet to show incorrect balances.<br>
            <blockquote>RPC calls which are impacted by the broken
              rescan functionality:<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; importprivkeyeserver<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; importaddress<br>

            </blockquote>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently working on fixing the
            "rescan bug" in raventoo-qt, properly relabelling the
            buttons in the "Wallet Repair" tab of the GUI "Debug
            Window", and automatically invoking a rescan after
            mnemonically re-creating a wallet.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <u><i>Helpful Workaround:<br>
                <br>
              </i></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the "rescan bug" is
            properly fixed in the code, the following temporary hack can
            be used to painlessly and quickly fix wallets which show
            incorrect balances or missing transactions after re-creating
            a wallet from BIP-39 mnemonic seed words (and optional
            mnemonic passphrase), or after replacing a lost/corrupted
            "wallet.dat" file with an old backup, or after use of one of
            the troublesome RPC calls listed above:<br>
            <br>
            <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>After booting raven-qt
                with the replaced or re-created "wallet.dat" file, go to
                the "Console" tab of the "Debug Window". In the text
                entry field, issue the command "rescanblockchain" and
                hit &lt;Return&gt;. That's it !! A progress box will
                open showing the rescan progress. After the scan
                finishes, you will see notifications for all your
                relevant transactions as if they had just occurred and
                your balances should be correct. This works because all
                the needed resources were already stable in memory when
                the rescan was requested</i>.<br>
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <b>Technical Details About "Wallet.dat" and Rescan
              Functionality</b><br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ravencoin maintains a LevelDB database
            (in the subdirectory blocks/index) which keeps track of
            where to find all the blocks in the "blk?????.dat" files on
            the disk. It also keeps track of all the unspent current
            coin and asset locations (the UTXO set or chainstate) using
            LevelDB databases in the "chainstate" and "assets"
            subdirectories. These LevelDB databases are required to be
            kept valid and up to date for all RVN and assets UTXOs in
            order for the node to be able to confirm compliance with the
            consensus rules. If this information is not valid, the node
            will suffer from much more serious problems than only
            displaying incorrect wallet balances. The "reindex"
            operation rebuilds all three of these databases from the
            on-disk "blk?????.dat" files. This is a very long duration
            operation, but it should never be necessary unless the
            databases have somehow become corrupted. Note that none of
            these databases contain all the detailed information about
            transactions which the wallet needs. A reindex operation
            also forces a rescan operation, which succeeds because all
            the required resources are available before beginning the
            rescan..<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for your wallet to know the
            amount of RVN coins and various assets which you own, which
            addresses they reside in, and the details of all relevant
            transactions, the wallet must keep track of all transactions
            related to its addresses. It does this in the background on
            a real-time basis and keeps all that data together with
            keys, addresses, and metadata in a BerkelyDB database in the
            "wallet.dat" file. If the "wallet.dat" file is replaced with
            an old copy, then it will be missing newer transactions (if
            any transactions involving your addresses occurred). If you
            manually import keys into your wallet, then it will be
            missing the transactions for those keys (if there were any).
            If the wallet file is replaced with a new wallet which was
            re-created using your 12 mnemonic words, then it will be
            missing all transactions. In any of these cases, it is
            necessary to fetch the missing transaction information for
            the "wallet.dat" database from the blockchain. The only way
            to do this is to scan through all of the "blk?????.dat"
            files on-disk to look for transactions involving your
            addresses. This operation is called a "rescan". It takes a
            short time (typically a few minutes up to an hour), but it
            is MUCH faster than a "reindex" (which can take many hours
            or even days) because it can use the LevelDB block index and
            is looking to retrieve a relatively small amount of

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that if you keep multiple
            "wallet.dat" files for different purposes with mutually
            exclusive addresses and transactions at addresses occur only
            when the appropriate wallet is active, then you can swap out
            "wallet.dat" files without seeing wrong balances because
            each wallet will keep track of its relevant transactions.
            This behavior is common amount miners, and they remain
            unaffected by the rescan bug when they behave in this
            manner.<br>
