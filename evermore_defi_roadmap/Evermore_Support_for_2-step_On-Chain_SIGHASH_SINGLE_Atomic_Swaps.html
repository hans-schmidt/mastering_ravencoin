            2-Step On-Chain Atomic Swaps can be constructed on Ravencoin
            by making available half-transaction offers using 1 input
            and 1 output and SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY. The
            swaps guarantee atomicity due to the all-or-nothing nature
            of transactions in which all inputs and outputs are executed
            or none of them are.<br>
            <br>
            The nice thing about this scheme is that there is no upfront
            negotiation needed. They are far simpler than traditional
            HTLC P2SH Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps, which require
            substantial off-chain communication between buyer and
            seller. In a 2-step swap, the seller posts an offer which is
            a partial transaction which basically says "I am willing to
            sell X and I don't care about any other inputs or outputs as
            long as I get Y". Any buyer who likes the terms can accept
            the offer by completing the transaction and submitting it.<br>
            <br>
            See the following resource describing the use of
            SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY to achieve this
            functionality: <br>

            <br>
            Note that there is really no difference between an "offer to
            sell" and an "offer to buy". An "offer to sell" uses an
            asset as the input with RVN as the ouput, while an "offer to
            buy" uses RVN is the input with an asset as the ouput.<br>

            Every UTXO can be an offer if new "desired swap" data fields
            are created and filled in by the offer creator during an
            asset transaction. Retracting or revising an offer is then
            simply done by creating another transaction which transfers
            the asset to a new UTXO with new data in the "desired swap"
            fields.<br>
            <br>
            Note that this eliminates the need for a database or a
            broadcast channel for offer tracking and transmission since
            the blockchain itself serves those functions.<br>

            These new data fields are only informational and unused in
            the transaction in which they are written into an output of
            that transaction. But they contain the information necessary
            for anyone to create a spending transaction which accepts
            the offer described by the new data fields. <br>
            <br>
            Traders can wait for the new UTXOs to be mined before
            searching them and submitting matching acceptance
            transactions. But nothing prevents buyers from snooping the
            P2P node traffic, in which case an offer and its acceptance
            could be mined sequentially into the same block. <br>
            <br>
            Of course a separate database and separate communication
            channel could still be used to track and broadcast offers in
            order to save on transaction fees.<br>

            <br>
            One inefficiency of this scheme is that buyers must match
            the exact qty of the offer by creating a matching UTXO. In a
            competition amoung buyers, miners will insure that only one
            of the buyers will be allowed to take the offered UTXO and
            the other buyers' transactions will be rejected with no
            transaction fee. Nevertheless, the all-or-nothing
            requirement of the swapped quantity limits the number of
            possible buyers and complicates swap completion.<br>
            <br>
            An even larger inefficiency is in price discovery. On-chain
            offers as described above are a useful mechanism to
            bootstrap a DEX since they eliminate the need for a database
            or a broadcast channel to track the offers. But on-chain
            atomic swaps are best viewed as settlement (delivery) rather
            than price discovery. 2-step offers can migrate off-chain
            using an out-of-band broadcast channel for better
            performance, but improving price discovery requires support
            for more complex order types such as Market, Stop, Limit,
            Stop_Limit, and Stop_Market. <br>
            <br>
            Both quantity flexibility and improved price discovery can
            be improved by adding the following UTXO data field

            during a future transaction which spends that output by
            using it as an input, the consensus rules read these new
            fields to determine whether the spending transaction
            satisfies the requirements set by these fields. The spending
            transaction may have a Vout value (final settlement
            quantity) which is different than Ask_Qty due to partial
            order fulfillment (based on Granularity) or price change
            (within the rules set by Order_Type, Stop, and Limit).<br>

            Price Discovery can be made even more efficient. Large
            liquid markets implementing full bid/ask order books will
            remain more efficient for many asset pairs than most other
            market implementations. In those cases, it is advantageous
            to support the use of an Oracle for price discovery.

            Note that the Oracle is chosen by the owner of the UTXO
            making the offer. It is up to the other party to decide
            whether to accept that Oracle by taking the deal. <br>
            <br>
            Note also that it would not be practical in any case for the
            Oracle to simply be an asset metadata field chosen by the
            asset issuer because there will likely be different Oracles
            based on the other asset in the trading pair. <br>
            <br>
            Note that neither nodes nor miners are responsible for
            creating transactions from offers, though they may choose to
            do so. They are not required to determine whether completed
            transactions can be assembled from matching broadcasted
            half-transactions nor from previous transactions containing
            offers. They are also not responsible for connecting to
            Oracles and determining prices which fulfill the order
            requirements. Any party can execute those functions to build
            and submit full transactions in the hope that they will be
            mined and they can make a profit on the bid/ask spread. That
            will be true of fixed price offers as well as for the
            complex order types. Full nodes (including miners) will have
            modified concensus rules which implement the new rules
            regarding partial order fulfillment, complex orders, and/or
            Oracle-guided pricing to insure that the submitted
            transactions satisfy those new rules.<br>

              <li>Normal UTXO trading uses traditional price discovery
                negotiated between buyers and sellers. But such trading
                requires high-speed order books and cannot be done
                on-chain. While such legacy trades should always be an
                available option, a more efficient on-chain market can
                be implemented if Oracles are used to set the price of
                trades. Fairly simple changes to Ravencoin can be
                implemented which use Oracle price setting and 2-step
                On-Chain Atomic Swaps to implement much more efficient
                and flexible trade types including
                Precise(Legacy)/Market/Stop/Limit/Stop_Limit/Stop_Market.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Note that if the token being traded represents an
                off-chain asset, then even with Oracle price setting,
                the token requires a stable coin mechanism to bind the
                token to the off-chain asset, or it must trade in a pair
                with a stable-coin asset. This is needed to provide an
                arbitrage mechanism to anchor the on-chain price to its
                off-chain value. Otherwise, Oracle inaccuracies and
                computational round-off errors will accumulate to create

            Remember that the goal of RavencoinPlus is to implement
            low-level plumbing support for defi in a bitcoin-like
            architecture without committing to specific defi
            implementations when there are choices. Price discovery, for
            instance, can be done in a number of ways. Many of the
            newest defi projects use Automated Market Makers (AMMs)
            using a variety of experimental formulas. Using an Oracle in
            the low-level protocol is implementation agnostic because
            the Oracle could be an on-chain AMM, an AMM on another
            chain, or a price feed from a Centralized Exchange. Or, just
            leave the Oracle field blank and Ravencoin will work just
            like it does now with you deciding the price- it is forward
            flexible and backward compatible.<br>
            <br>
            The simplest and most flexible solution is to allow
            selection of the Oracle to be made by the party making the
            offer, and it is up to the other party to decide whether to
            accept that Oracle by taking the deal.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Note that the Oracle cannot simply be an asset
                metadata field chosen by the asset issuer because there
                will likely be different Oracles based on the other
                asset in the trading pair.</li>
            </ul>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            The use of Oracles is best suited for trade between tokens
            who's prices are pegged to well-known assets since a
            reliable Oracle is needed which "knows" the price with high
            confidence. But since the party making the offer selects the
            Oracle and the party accepting the offer is also accepting
            the Oracle choice, this is not a problem. <br>
            <br>
            For well-known common crytpo assets, price discovery is
            already done well on many centralized exchanges. Those will
            remain the best sources of price information for the
            foreseeable future and an Oracle should be chosen which uses
            a data feed from one or more centralized exchanges. <br>
            <br>
            Oracles are available from some distributed exchanges, but
            they are less reliable because distributed exchanges have
            insufficient capacity or speed to implement Limit Order
            Books like centralized exchanges which handle by far most of
            the volume. Those limitation imply that there is a greater
            risk of manipulation of a DEX-derived price Oracle&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            It would be possible to implement the Oracle by letting
            miners "vote" on the best source (as in Pegnet), but that is
            complex, and it is subject to manipulation by miners and
            attackers.<br>
            <br>
            Note that when trading tokens on Ravencoin when the tokens
            represent off-chain assets, the token trade can be viewed as
            the close of price agreement between the parties, but
            without settlement. Settlement is the act of delivery of the
            off-chain asset in exchange for the Ravencoin token.
            Settlement can happen at a later time, or be replaced by
            anoter token trade, or can be settled in RVN rather than in
            the underlying asset. This also means that if settlement is
            implemented using a cross-chain atomic swap technology, then
            there need be no concern about the possible existence of
            free options in the atomic swap protocol because the price
            has already been fixed and the sale committed. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            Some well known sources of Oracles are already available: <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Chainlink Price Reference Data contract</li>
              <li>Compound's Open Price Feed</li>
              <li>Okcoin Oracle signed price feed</li>
            </ul>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            New technologies such as "Gravity Protocol" are expected to
            make Oracles much more common, not only for price discovery,
            but also for a variety of inter-blockchain data
            communications<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            Developing and providing Oracles as a for-profit business is
            expected to be a good opportunity for independent vendors<br>
