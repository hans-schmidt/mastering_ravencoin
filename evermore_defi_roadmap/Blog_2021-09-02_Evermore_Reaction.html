                  to the Evermore Defi Roadmap Proposal</big></big><br>
              <br>
            </div>
            The Evermore Defi Roadmap proposal published last week
            stimulated a torrent of public reactions, DMs, and emails.
            All of the messages stated opinions, and many requested
            further explanation from me.<br>
            <br>
            Before attempting to satisfy those requests, I would like to
            express my gratitude for the overall positive attitude
            toward me in the messages I received. Most people know that
            I have never requested donations or any compensation for the
            work which I do on Ravencoin. I knew when I decided to
            include a funding proposal together with the technical
            content, that I was "kicking the hornet nest" in order to
            study the reaction. While researchers who use that strategy
            may learn important information, it can be difficult to feel
            much empathy when they get stung. Yet, although many people
            expressed disapproval of the funding portion of the
            proposal, every single respondent took effort to make clear
            that the criticisms were targeted at the proposal and not at
            me, and to thank me for my efforts. Not even the most
            vitriolic members of the community attacked me personally,
            which is a very positive statement about the quality of the
            community. Thank you for your restraint and for your
            objectiveness.<br>
            <br>
            Now, at the risk of further antagonizing the hornets and
            getting stung after all, I will document a few of my
            opinions and conclusions:<br>
            <br>
            <u><b>1) </b></u><u><b>Some facts about the fee-based
                development fund proposal</b></u>:<br>
            <br>
            I chose the published funding proposal because I judged it
            to be the least problematic and most practical of the
            available funding choices. However, in addition to any
            concerns related to centralization, it is a fairly weak
            economic plan. Contrary to the concern expressed by some
            people that it would be a money-grab by developers, it would
            have a good chance of failing due to providing too little
            money. The initial unburning of asset fees would provide
            about $1.5 Million, which is enough to sustain a small
            development team for one or two years. But after that, the
            funds provided by fees would be insufficient unless activity
            on the network increased by about 150x. If the developers
            could in fact make that happen, then they would surely have
            more than justified their salaries. <br>
            <br>
            The primary advantage of a fees-based Development Fund is
            that it would provide a built-in alignment of incentives in
            the same way that stock options do in companies. Even after
            increasing transaction fees last year by 100x because they
            were too close to dust, they add up to less than $300 per
            week. Ravencoin adoption for real-world use cases other than
            mining has been an abysmal failure and most blocks are
            nearly empty.<br>
            <br>
            It is worth mentioning that concerns were raised about
            whether a fee-based Development Fund would endanger
            Ravencoin's status as a currency rather than a security.
            Currently, those are speculations which may or may not be
            legitimate concerns. It does seem appropriate and prudent
            for the Ravencoin Foundation to seek expert legal advice on
            this topic. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <u><b>2) </b></u><u><b>Some analysis of the community
                reaction</b></u>:<br>
            <br>
            Many members of the Ravencoin community view Ravencoin first
            and foremost as a strictly-decentralized GPU-mined
            semi-clone of bitcoin. They strongly believe that Ravencoin
            must never compromise on any aspect inconsistent with the
            bitcoin mindset. The open-source maximally-decentralize
            design must persist. Bitcoin's only governance is the
            miners. Satoshi did not get paid for his code development
            efforts. Those should hold for Ravencoin, they say.<br>
            <br>
            Yet many of those same members focus their public
            communication on Ravencoin's asset capabilities and complain
            of Ravencoin's lack of participation in Defi.<br>
            <br>
            <u>Let me be clear: Bitcoin does not and cannot participate
              in Defi. Being a Defi participant and being a bitcoin
              semi-clone are mutually exclusive goals.</u><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Defi has developed into a fast-moving innovative
                high-transaction-volume business which requires very
                active code development and funding mechanisms to pay
                for those developers.</li>
              <li>Bitcoin is primarily a store of value rather than a
                method of exchange. It moves slowly and carefully. Code
                developers are nice to have, but are not particularly
                needed. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Evermore was designed for people who want Ravencoin to
            become a leading participant in Defi, which requires
            compromises in decentralization, governance, and development
            funding. It is my belief that Ravencoin is far better suited
            than Ethereum to deliver the promises of Defi with decent
            security. I also believe that Defi represents Ravencoin's
            best chance of maximum price and market cap. But not
            everyone wants those changes or agrees with that prediction.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ravencoin could have value as an alternative store of value
            based on GPU mining. Ravencoin's coinbase halving next
            January and the growing crowd of GPU miners being forced off
            of Ethereum may provide sufficient reasons for Ravencoin's
            price and market cap to grow dramatically in the coming
            months. The fact that virtually all Ravencoin miners run
            proprietary closed-source mining software shows the limits
            of their commitment to open source. The fact that Ravencoin
            was founded based on some ideas about blockchain assets may
            become an irrelevant historic fact which almost nobody uses.
            There will always be hobbyists, of course, just as there are
            still 1980-vintage Atari video game enthusiasts. But that is
            unrelated to Defi.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Some community members have expressed the opinion that a
            Developer Fund should be set up using community donations.
            This is certainly worth exploring, but the amount of money
            needed would be far more than ever raised before. Moreover,
            talented developers would not consider such a system
            competitive and worthy of risking their careers unless there
            was sufficient confidence that funding would continue on an
            ongoing basis.<br>
            <br>
            Another option would be for code development to be in a
            Corporation funded by private Venture Capital. There has
            been some discussion of building a proprietary closed-source
            permissioned network on top of Ravencoin using merge mining.
            It is likely that miners would cooperate for even a small
            additional amount of income. This may prove to be the most
            practical path forward, but it is the farthest from the
            principles on which Ravencoin was founded.<br>
            <br>
            It is a market truism that the economic value of something
            is equal to how much people are willing to pay for it. That
            sends an unambiguous message about the value of code
            development on Ravencoin.<br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>These are all very different visions for the future of
                Ravencoin. </li>
              <li>If you are a Ravencoin hodler or miner, I cannot tell
                you the future. Your crystal ball is as good as mine. </li>
              <li>But if you are a talented code developer who wants to
                work on a fast moving blockchain project which will
                value your contribution, then I can provide some
                guidance about where to work and where not to waste your
                efforts at this point in time. </li>
            </ul>
