            Evermore is not a new coin. It is not a chain split. It is
            not a code split. It is an extended roadmap for Ravencoin
            which would make Ravencoin much more powerful. It IS
            Ravencoin - on steroids.<br>
            <br>
            Ravencoin is wonderful blockchain asset technology. It is
            elegant. It is simple. It is secure. It can be made much
            more powerful.<br>
            Bitcoin's simple protocols and UTXO model are Ravencoin's
            strengths, to which Ravencoin adds simple enhancements to
            natively understand assets. Similar enhancements could
            provide it with an understanding of partial order
            fulfillment, stop-limit orders, interest rates, options and
            futures contracts, and many other useful financial
            primitives. <br>
            <br>
            The entrenched Wall Street oligarchs and their political
            puppets have succeeded in preventing the wide-spread
            emergence of KYC Security Token Offerings (STOs) as
            anticipated in the original Ravencoin whitepaper and
            roadmap. That mainstream vision by Bruce Fenton and Tron
            Black is dead (or at least dormant). If Ravencoin wants to
            prosper, this new roadmap could make it a leader in Defi
            without the security risks inherent in overly complex smart
            contracts. <br>

            on how Ravencoin might be extended to add many of the needed
            capabilities. But Evermore does not exist. It is only a set
            of proposals for what <u><i>could</i></u> exist, but only
            if sufficient engineering effort is put into implementing

                  <a name="Evermore_Guiding_Principles"></a>Evermore
                  Guiding Principles:</b></font></u><br>
            <b><br>
            </b>1) Continue to build Ravencoin in the spirit of Bitcoin-
            decentralized, permissionless, as simple as possible.<br>
            <br>
            2) Extend the Ravencoin architecture with simple intuitive
            features designed to make Ravencoin an excellent platform
            for Defi. When core Defi concepts become standardized,
            simple native support should be hard-coded into the
            Ravencoin protocol.<br>
            <br>
            3) Do not change the founding economic principles related to
            coinbase rewards of miners of Ravencoin when adding new
            features. No change to coinbase rewards or schedules. No
            mining tax.<br>
            <br>
            4) Whenever possible, add new ways for Ravencoin users and
            nodes to benefit financially from use of the chain.
            Successful participation in Defi requires a rich ecosystem
            of participants earning money in a variety of ways.<br>
            <br>
            5) Support for new functionality in Ravencoin means changes
            to the protocols, data structures, and RPC calls as well as
            changes to the consensus rules in raven-qt/ravend. But it
            does not require GUI support in raven-qt for all its
            features because there will be far too many options and
            functions to support them all. GUI support and related
            services are best provided by ecosystem vendors through
            additional applications or websites on a for-profit basis.
            Just as TCP and HTML provide the low-level support on which
            internet businesses are built, the various low-level
            blockchain features of Ravencoin will be able to support a
            range of product and service vendor businesses.<br>
            <br>
            6) Adding new data fields to the transaction and UTXO
            specification will increase the on-disk and in-memory
            storage requirements and the sync time for full nodes, and
            therefore should be given appropriate consideration.
            However, the required increase to support most financial
            primitives is expected to be modest. Unlike account-based
            systems such as Ethereum or extended-UTXO systems such as
            Cardano, the changes will not be storing arbitrary
            persistent system state. Ravencoin core sync code has not
            yet been very well optimized, and future technologies such
            as Utreexo and Flyclient may provide additional solutions.<br>
            <br>
            7) Ravencoin's success depends on Code Development. Code
            Development requires salaried funding- bounties don't work
            for anything beyond bug fixes and small feature additions.
            Medici spent over $720K/yr, which was quite small compared
            to many projects. <br>

            </b>1) Implement the <a moz-do-not-send="true"

              Ravencoin Improvement Proposal</a>.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Vault assets are assets which have a "face value" of
                RVN and can be "melted" to extract the RVN. </li>
              <li>Vault assets can pay a daily interest rate as a % of
                the "face value" or a fixed amount of RVN. Or they can
                cost a daily demurrage rate as a % of the "face value"
                or a fixed amount of RVN.</li>
              <li>Vault assets have many interesting applications. They
                will be used by the consensus code to issue payments to
                help fund Code Development (see #3 here and "<a
                  moz-do-not-send="true"
                  href="#Evermore_Financial_Support">Evermore Weekly
                  Financial Support for Code Development</a>" for
                details).</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            2) Implement Reusable Payment Addresses: A mechanism which
            creates different non-linkable addresses so that on-chain
            balances and payment totals can remain private. This is a
            highly desired feature for businesses who want to advertise
            a payment address yet maintain some financial privacy.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Similar technologies have been used on BCH
                (BIP-Stealth) and BTC (Stealth Addresses) as well as in
                Monero</li>
              <li>Note that this works better on Ravencoin than on BTC
                or BCH because of RVN's common use of extraneous data
                on-chain (put the nonce in the IPFS field)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            3) Begin to issue ^RVNDEV Vault assets once per week to help
            fund Code Development (see "<a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="#Evermore_Financial_Support">Evermore Weekly
              Financial Support for Code Development</a>" for more
            details)<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Note that charitable donations to help fund Ravencoin
                Code Development will still be needed; especially until
                the new roadmap is implemented and chain fees increase
                to provide income</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            4) Add DEX support: See "<a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="Evermore_Support_for_2-step_On-Chain_SIGHASH_SINGLE_Atomic_Swaps.html#Level-1_DEX_Support">Level-1






              DEX Support" in
              "Evermore_Support_for_2-step_On-Chain_SIGHASH_SINGLE_Atomic_Swaps</a>"
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Enhanced support for 2-step
                SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY On-Chain Atomic
                Swaps by adding Asset_Name/Ask_Qty/Signature fields to
                every UTXO to communicate the desired trade. This makes
                it possible to do offer tracking and broadcast on-chain
                as a way to bootstrap initial DEX activity without
                requiring a new database of communication channel. DEX
                trading can also be taken off-chain to speed up activity
                and to save transaction fees.&nbsp; </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            5) Add Asset Consumption support: See "<a
              moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Consumable_Assets">Consumable_Assets</a>"
            below for details.
            <ul>
              <li>Assets can be destroyed as well as issued. This
                capability is important for on-chain tokens which
                represent off-chain assets, such as wrapped-bitcoin, for
                which the number of tokens in existence should be
                adjusted up or down to match the number of bitcoin in
                escrow. As another example, assets can be issued as
                one-time-use utility tickets which are consumed
                (destroyed) when used. This is particularly useful when
                used with expiring unique assets (#11 below).</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            6) Add Asset tolls support: See "<a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="#Asset_Tolls">Asset_Tolls</a>" below for details.
            <ul>
              <li>Each asset will be given a metadata field indicating a
                required per-asset Toll qty of RVN (or % of face value
                for Vault assets) paid to the asset owner whenever that
                asset is transferred. The transfer of an asset from one
                address to another address in the same wallet could be
                used as a method of requesting and paying for a service.
                Tolls are extremely useful as a way to pay Liquidity
                Providers who agree to lock up valuable assets on other
                chains in order to provide Wrapped tokens for trade on
                Ravencoin.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            7) Add Covenant support: See "<a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="#Financial_Derivatives">Financial_Derivatives</a>"
            below for details.
            <ul>
              <li>Covenants will allow Ravencoin script to support more
                complex smart contracts within limitations. In
                particular, an options contract or futures contract on
                the sale of a valuable token or stablecoin can reside in
                a separate contract token which can be traded separately
                from the value token. Recent research on the necessary
                contracts and the mechanism to link the contracts to a
                tradeable token separate from the underlying value asset
                token indicate that this is possible using the covenant
                opcode extensions which have already been in production
                use for a few years on Blockstream's Liquid Network
                blockchain. <br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            8) Implement a 2-way Peg BTC-Relay to provide Wrapped-BTC
            liquidity for trading. <br>
            <ul>
              <li>RVNWBTC tokens can be issued on the Ravencoin
                blockchain specifying a non-zero toll, so the liquidity
                providers earn a toll every time a RVNWBTC token is
                traded.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Technically, the implementation is similar to a P2SH
                HTLC Cross-chain Atomic Swap. During a Peg-in it locks
                up BTC on the bitcoin blockchain and issues an equal
                number of RVNWBTC on the Ravencoin blockchain. During a
                Peg-out, the RVNWBTC must be consumed and the BTC are
                returned on the bitcoin blockchain. If BTC and RVN had
                sufficiently powerful scripting, this could easily be
                fully automated as a Relay. Since that is not the case,
                and to improve security, many projects implement it as a
                Trusted Federation as done by Blockstream for LBTC on
                the Liquid blockchain, by Rootstock for RBTC on RSK, and
                by WBTC for Ethereum. In some juridiction, this solution
                creates KYC requirements for the users. Other projects
                use more complex solutions to fully automate the Relay
                such as by running both RVN and BTC chains and transfer
                code in a Trusted Execution Environment (as done by
                pTokens for pBTC) or running a Secure Multi-party
                Computation on distributed VMs (as done for Ren). The
                maturity of the available solutions and regulatory
                changes relating to stablecoins will dictate the best
                solution.</li>

                Order Fullfillment" with specified "Granularity". They
                can also support different order types:
                Precise(Legacy)/Market/Stop/Limit/Stop_Limit/Stop_Market.
                This primarily requires only new data fields in the UTXO
                definition and a change in the related consensus rules.
                Independent vendors are responsible for matching offer
                and seller half-transactions for submission to the
                miners, for which those vendors can make a profit on the
                spread. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>It is interesting to note that most of these features
                and Ravencoin-like asset trading were proposed as a
                bitcoin extension by Mark Friedenbach in 2013 for his
                Freicoin project, but the project was dropped when Adam
                Back convinced Mark to become a co-founder of
                Blockstream instead. </li>
            </ul>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            10)&nbsp; Implement a 2-way Peg Ethereum Relay to enable

            for BTC-Relay. <br>
            <br>
            11) Add Expiring Unique Assets: See "<a

            below for details.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Unique assets can be given a lifetime ranging from 1
                hour to eternal. The price for creating the asset will
                vary from 0.05 RVN (1 hour life) to 5 RVN (eternal
                life). <br>

            </ul>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

            for details.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>On-chain 2-step Atomic Swap support for Oracle-based
                price discovery can provide another vast improvement in
                price discovery and flexibility. Markets use many
                different methods of price discovery. Some use
                traditional off-chain bid/ask order books. Defi projects
                are experimenting with a variety of
                Automatic-Market-Maker algorithms. Oracle support allows
                the offer creator to select any Oracle of his choice
                based on the Oracle's public key and signed price
                reports. Only the price quote and signature format need
                to be standardized, and a few changes need to be made to
                the UTXO definition and consensus rules.&nbsp; The buyer
                can choose an Oracle from any independent vendor who
                provides that service on a for-profit basis. New
                technologies such as "Gravity Protocol" are expected to
                make Oracles much more common.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            13) Add a second IPFS field to asset metadata. See "<a

            taproot<br>
            <br>
            15) Implement Relays to additional popular blockchains: LTC,

                  there are advantages to being able to destroy assets

                <li>If used for voting, then destruction can be done
                  after voting is completed. More generally, If the

                  consumed after it is used to obtain the service.</li>
                <li>If the token represents a "wrapped" asset such as
