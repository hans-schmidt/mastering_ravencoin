            <b>Update 2021 May:</b><br>
            <br>
            The raventoo-qt repository has been deleted. <br>
            That project was a personalized and improved version of the
            raven-qt node for Ravencoin. <br>
            <br>
            A few months ago I decided to work within the Ravencoin
            community to launch Special Interest Groups (SIGs) in order
            to lead and expand the amount of code development taking
            place in the community in a volunteer distributed manner in
            the spirit of bitcoin. That effort has been well accepted by
            the community, and now consists of many talented
            hard-working developers working on different projects in
            multiple SIGs. As the leader of the raven-qt SIG, all
            improvements to raven-qt are now made in that SIG. <br>
            <br>
            For more information, please see the SIG website at:<br>

            <u><b>Improvements made in raventoo-qt:</b></u><br>
            <br>
            1) raventoo-qt now has a re-designed dialog window GUI for
            entering BIP39 seed words and passphrase when setting up the
            wallet. For details see <a
              href="Improving_the_raven-qt_Mnemonic_Dialog.html">HERE</a><br>
            <br>
            2) TBD...&nbsp; if I have time over the Christmas holiday, I
            may look at adding messaging support to the GUI<br>

              What is raventoo-qt?</b><b><br>
            </b>
            <ul>
              <li>raventoo-qt is my personal version of the Ravencoin
                raven-qt node and wallet client. For details about
                Ravencoin, see: <a href="https://ravencoin.org">https://ravencoin.org</a><br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <b><br>
              How is raventoo-qt different from raven-qt?</b><br>
            <ul>
              <li>The "too" in raventoo implies that raventoo intends to
                be fully compatible with the official Ravencoin raven-qt
                client for all consensus rules (it is NOT a chain fork).</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>The differences between raventoo-qt and raven-qt are
                purely related to GUI and ease-of-use features as well
                as possible performance enhancements. The raven-qt
                software has been under-maintained recently due to lack
                of resources. I also have limited time, but have started
                to invest some effort for my own fun and education. I am
                simply posting the results here for anyone else who has
                interest.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>Why not just put this into pull requests for the
              community version?</b><br>
            <ul>
              <li>My intention is that most code modifications posted
                here will also be useable as pull requests for the
                official client. There may be situations where I make
                style or feature choices for my own use while the
                community has a different preference. Plus, I and just
                playing and learning.</li>
