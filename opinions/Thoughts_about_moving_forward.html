            Ravencoin needs to increase the pace of development progress
            quickly or risk being left behind.<br>
            The recent increase in interest has been great, but we have
            already lost many new members who were disappointed by poor
            useability and poor scalability.<br>
            <br>
            Imho we are stalling because we have not yet properly
            adapted to a future without Medici. All eyes appear to be
            looking to the Foundation as the new centralized entity
            which will provide Ravencoin's leadership and resources. But
            the Foundation will not and should not provide centralized
            leadership.<br>
            <br>
            In Friday's meeting, Bruce Fenton raised his concern that
            the community has been conflating Development and the
            Foundation, while in fact they are not the same thing at
            all. He proposed that they should be treated as separate
            entities even if it is many of the same people. I strongly
            agree. <br>
            <br>
            The Foundation is not Ravencoin. The Foundation was created
            as a centralized entity for those circumstances when a
            centralized entity is unfortunately unavoidable. It can
            provide a corporate entity to hold a bank account or an
            "official" contact person as required by some
            crypto-exchanges. But in no sense is the Foundation
            "officially" Ravencoin. It is a few volunteers and a
            corporate entity which should do what the community wants
            them to do.<br>
            <br>
            Ravencoin's technology is decentralized. Ravencoin's people
            are decentralized. Ravencoin should be decentralized.
            Period. That is vital for practical and legal reasons. There
            are many centralized ICO-funded blockchain projects with
            centralized websites, centralized Github accounts,
            centralized management. That is not Ravencoin. <br>
            <br>
            Many people seem to believe that bitcoin has an "official"
            Github repository at "github.com/bitcoin". But it is not
            "official". That repository just happens to be the most
            trusted because they have attracted many talented devs,
            found the most funding, and done the best job. Electrum,
            mobile wallets, and countless other bitcoin projects are all
            independent with no "official" Github account or repository.
            Bitcoin has no "official" home.<br>
            <br>
            I have heard complaints that Ravencoin lacks leadership. But
            we should not be looking to the Foundation. We should look
            to each other and build the needed organization.<br>
            <br>
            <b><u>In my opinion, my recommendations are:</u></b><br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>The Foundation and a Code Committee (consisting of a
                volunteer leader and other dev volunteers) need to build
                and manage separate organizations and procedures because
                we don't want centralization, because they have
                different priorities, and because they are both big
                efforts.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Items which require formal voting such as setting
                policies and procedures must be done by the Foundation
                or on-chain because forums like Discord cannot prevent
                duplicate account creation. But informal surveys can be
                used for most routine decisions once policies are
                established.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>The Code Committee should do administrative work
                common to all code projects. It should form code SIGs
                (Special Interest Groups) like an Electrum SIG and a
                Mobile Wallet SIG, and recruit a volunteer leader and
                other volunteers for each SIG. Code-related items which
                require voting such as standardizing the bounty approval
                procedure should be drafted by the Code Committee and
                submitted to the Foundation or on-chain for voting.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>The Code Committee and each SIG should pick a
                non-conflicting one-hour weekly time slot during which
                they will meet on Discord in their own channels to
                discuss their focus topics. We could post a combined
                meeting calendar on "teamup.com".</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>The SIGs should decide on the goals, milestones, and
                timeline for their projects. The SIGs should decide how
                their project can be broken into the smallest
                incremental bounties, how much the bounties should pay,
                what the deliverables are, and when they have been met.
                The SIGs should submit those recommendations to the Code
                Committee for check against policies, which will then
                submit them for vote by the Foundation or on-chain for
                financial approval. Once approved, it is OK for SIG
                participants to participate in the bounties, and they
                most often will do so, since they are the subject matter
                experts.</li>
            </ul>
            <b><br>
              Lastly, for those who don't agree with any of this:<br>
              Ravencoin remains an open source project. Anyone can write
              and run any software they want and can even fork the
              project if they have the desire and the skill to do so.</b><br>

            <u>Some Foundation-related things which I would like to see

            <ul>
              <li>Which non-code things should the Foundation control

            <ul>
              <li>Can someone put together a list of all the major
                Ravencoin-related websites &amp; github accounts and who
                owns them or has control?</li>
              <ul>
                <li>What about social media accounts (Discord, Telegram,
                  Reddit, etc) and who owns, controls, moderates them?</li>
                <li>Post them on the Foundation website</li>
                <li>The point of the exercise is transparency, not to
